                  The contents of this dashboard are a high-level overview of
                  the network and are subject to change as StorX refines its
                  plans. Changes to the network, the SRX Tokens, and other
                  information referenced in this post are entirely within the
                  discretion of StorX, and could result from commercial,
                  technical, or legal issues, among others. We believe that
                  greater transparency will contribute to the willingness of
                  users, storage node operators, and other service providers to
                  participate in the network. While we have made every attempt
                  to be accurate, it is provided as-is, and you should not rely
                  on this report for any decisions regarding the use,
                  acquisition, or disposition of StorX Tokens (SRX).
